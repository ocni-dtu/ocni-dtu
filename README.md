# My Background
Since I took my first course in Python as an exchange student at National University of Singapore, I haven't looked back.

Initially I wanted learn to code because I was using Grasshopper and wanted to become better and understand the concepts behind it.
My choice fell on Python because I had heard about it during my studies and because I had discovered Ladybug and Honeybee, which were written in Python.

It was the hardest university course I ever took.

After the first two thirds of the semester I still didn't get it.
The concepts and the way of thinking were totally foreign to me and different from the other civil engineering and design courses I took.

In the beginning I was totally oblivious to it. I couldn't even complete the homework assignments we got.
Luckily, I had a couple of friends at NUS, who were studying Computer Science there, who helped me out.

Today, coding is my job.

I still use my civil engineering knowledge and what I code is for the building industry, but I don't consider myself a civil engineer anymore.

I started studying civil engineering because I liked to build things. 
When I code, I build things.
